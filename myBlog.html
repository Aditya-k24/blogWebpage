    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <ul class="hobbies">
        
        <br><li class="football">Football</li> <br>
           One of the sports I absolutely love seeing and playing as well. I was in my school team as well, as a <br> 
           defender and playing it everyday after studying was the best feeling ever. I fell in love with football <br>
            after watch in GOAT(Lionel Messi) play. <br>
        <br><li class="piano">Piano</li><br>
            I have been playing the piano for a ling time but it was the lockdown when I got really good at it. <br>
            You can check out my instagram for few of my covers.<br>
            <button class="bttn" buttoncolor="black"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/_mindful.music_/">Instagram</a></button><br>
        <br><li class="pics">Photography</li>
            Some of the pictures i have taken are:- <br>
        <br><li class="trek">Treking</li><br>
            My dad got me into the hobby of treking. Before the lockdown we used to go on several terks near Mumbai <br> and Pune. <br>
        <br><li class="cycle">Cycling</li><br>
            Another hobby of mine which i picked up from my dad. We cycle to a random destination twice every month <br> about 25km-30km everytime. <br>
        <br><li class="work">Working Out</li><br>
            I used to be overweight and quite a chubby kid but in the last few years I decided to loose some weight. <br> In this lockdow I am very proud to admit the i was able to loose 20Kg. <br>
        <br><li class="eat">Eating</li><br>
            I do hold back on the quanntity of food i eat but i certainly don't hold back on what I eat. My mom is a <br> wonderful cook and due to her I was able to taste multiple cuisine. <br>
